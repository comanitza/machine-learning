It of course can be just a scalar or a vector but usualy in practice is a multi dimensional array. Tensors in PyTorch are similar to python lists or numpy arrays but offer more features and are designed to work with big amounts of data and are optimised for GPUs, this makes the ideal for deep learning applications.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nimport numpy as np","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.113847Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.114300Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.119725Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.114270Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.118613Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Basic Tensor creation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating a tensor with a scalar value\nt1 = torch.tensor(4)\nprint(t1)\n\n# create a tensor from a vector\nt2 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])\nprint(t2)\n\n# creating  bidemensional array/matrix\nt3 = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\nprint(t3)\n\n# now let's prin the shapes of the created tensors\n\n# the shape of the first tensor, it's just a scalar, so the shape is 1\nprint(t1.shape)\n\n# the shape of the second tensor, this is a vector of thre elements, so the shape is 1 * 3\nprint(t2.shape)\n\n# the third tensor it'a a matrix of 3 * 3 elements, so this is our shape\nprint(t3.shape)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.121833Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.122494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.136801Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.122462Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.135560Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Using specific devices","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Tensor types","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's again create a tensor, by default when creating a tensor from a list the type of the data is long/int64\nt1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])\n# we can inspect the type of the elements from the tensor like this\nprint(t1.dtype)\n\n# now let's create a tensor with the datatype float/float32\nt2 = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6], dtype=torch.float32)\nprint(t2.dtype)\n\n# let's now convert an existing tensor's data type, in our case from long/int64 to double/float64\nt3 = t1.double()\nprint(t3.dtype)\n\n# to wrap this section let's print the tensors we created\nprint(t1)\nprint(t2)\nprint(t3)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.138502Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.139546Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.149998Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.139503Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.148765Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Gradient","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Special Tensor creation methods","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's create a tensor with just zeroes of the desiered dimensions\n# please note that these methos return tensors with float/float32 datatypes\nt1 = torch.zeros((2, 2))\nprint(t1)\n\n# now we will create a tensor filled just with ones, of the desired dimension but with the specified datatype \nt2 = torch.ones((2, 3, 4), dtype=torch.int64)\nprint(t2)\n\n# we can create a tensor with random values of the wanted dimension like in the example bellow\nt3 = torch.rand((4, 4))\nprint(t3)\n\n# using the arange function we will create \nt4 = torch.arange(5)\nprint(t4)\n\nt5 = torch.arange(start=2, end=10, step=2)\nprint(t5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.152521Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.152978Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.166199Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.152940Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T21:48:47.165033Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Tensor integration with numpy","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Tensor concatenation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Indexing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Tensor dimensions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Squeeze and unsqueeze","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Reshaping","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Permutations","metadata":{}}]}
