It helped me to get a better understanding of the issue and I hope will also help others.  \n\n## What is PyTorch\nPyTorch is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.\n\n## What is a Tensor\nA tensor is a multydimensional matrix containing data of a single data type. It of course can be just a scalar or a vector but usualy in practice is a multi dimensional array. Tensors in PyTorch are similar to python lists or numpy arrays but offer more features and are designed to work with big amounts of data and are optimised for GPUs, this makes the ideal for deep learning applications.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# these are the only two imports we need, let's import them right at the start\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\n\n# also it's
